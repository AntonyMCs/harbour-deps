[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4bx4006pge6jbqch/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vsz/harbour-deps/branch/master)

# Automated, reproducible, transparent, Windows builds for [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/), [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org/), [libssh2](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2), [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) and [LibreSSL](http://www.libressl.org/)

  - Packaging aims to follow popular binary releases found on the Internet.
  - Both x86 and x64 packages are built using the same process.
  - Standalone `curl.exe` (only `msvcrt.dll` is required).
  - curl/libcurl are built with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) support enabled.
  - The build process is fully transparent by using publicly available
    open source code, C compiler, build scripts and running the
    build [in the public](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vsz/harbour-deps),
    with open, auditable [build logs](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vsz/harbour-deps/branch/master).
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes.
  - Generated binaries are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org), meaning
    they will have the same hash given the same input sources and C compiler.
  - Optional support for [libidn](https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/), [C-ares](http://c-ares.haxx.se) and [librtmp](https://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu).
  - Generated binaries are uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
